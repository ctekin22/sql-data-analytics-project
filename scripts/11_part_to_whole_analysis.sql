-- Step 11: Data Segmentation Analysis
-- Group the data based on a specific range
-- Helps understand the correlation between two measures
-- Measere by Measure
-- Introducing a new segment/category/dimension based on measure and 
-- then aggregating another measure based on this new category/dimension/segment
-- Use of CASE WHEN STATEMENTS
-- Convert measure to dimension
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Segment products into cost ranges and count how many products fall into each segment
-- MAX cost 2171, MIN cost 1
-- Convert measure to dimention -> cost to dimention

-- And find the total number of customers in each group

-- CTE must be the first clause in a statement** â€” no SELECT, WHERE, or anything else can come before it in the same query.
-- You can use a CTE in a subquery as long as the CTE is declared at the top level of the full query.
-- You cannot define a CTE inside a subquery.
-- Define the CTE first, then use it anywhere inside that same query, including subqueries.
